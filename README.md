# 🚀 Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 on Plant Pathogen Dataset 🌱

I recently completed a transfer learning project utilizing the MobileNetV2 model pre-trained on ImageNet weights to classify plant diseases in the Plant Pathogen Classification Dataset. This dataset includes images of plant diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, pests, and a separate class of healthy leaves. It provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in plant pathology and agriculture.

#🔧 Tools & Frameworks:

TensorFlow & Keras for model development
Transfer learning using pre-trained MobileNetV2
Feature engineering for optimal model performance

# 📊 Model Performance:

* Accuracy: 89.4% on test data
* Precision, Recall & F1-Score:
* Precision = 0.94, Recall = 0.83, F1-Score = 0.88
* Fungi: Precision = 0.93, Recall = 0.95, F1-Score = 0.94
* Healthy: Precision = 0.88, Recall = 0.90, F1-Score = 0.89
* Pests: Precision = 0.83, Recall = 0.92, F1-Score = 0.88
* Virus: Precision = 0.90, Recall = 0.87, F1-Score = 0.89
  
💡 Challenges: Data processing and model fitting were key hurdles, but through careful preprocessing and model tuning, I was able to achieve high performance.

🌍 Impact: This transfer learning approach can significantly aid researchers and practitioners by providing a tool to rapidly and accurately identify plant pathogens, which is crucial for timely intervention and better agricultural practices.

Looking forward to further improving this model and exploring more opportunities in the realm of computer vision and agriculture AI!
